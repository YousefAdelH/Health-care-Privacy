Privacy Policy

Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains the data practices for the Health Care app, developed by Youssef. This app is provided as a free service to assist in clinic management for small to medium-sized practices. By using this app, you agree to the data practices outlined below.

Information Collection and Use
The Health Care app uses Firebase Firestore to store information entered by users to support clinic management features, such as scheduling and record-keeping. This data is stored securely on Firebase servers and includes information like appointment details and patient records. We do not collect personally identifiable information unless necessary for the app’s functionality, and this data is only used for its intended purpose.

Firebase Firestore
We use Firebase Firestore to enable secure, cloud-based data storage. Firebase complies with major data protection regulations (such as GDPR and CCPA) and employs industry-standard security practices. Data stored on Firebase is protected and encrypted to ensure privacy and security. However, please note that Firebase may collect some technical data (such as usage metrics) for analytical purposes.

Cookies
The Health Care app itself does not use cookies. However, Firebase may collect data through cookies or similar technologies for analytics and app performance improvement.

Security
We prioritize your data’s security and work to protect it through commercially reasonable means. However, please be aware that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Firebase’s data encryption and compliance help mitigate risks, but absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

Children’s Privacy
This app is not designed for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect data from users under this age. If such data is identified, we will promptly delete it from our systems.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. Changes will be posted on this page, and users are encouraged to review it periodically.
